# Need to Fix

1. Still not working as desktop background (wallpaper application)
2. Need to create icon for app, and in UI create some printscreens for each background
3. Not able to see icons in desktop, same as problem 1 but little more specific
4. Need to add colorpicker in UI to select colors, as alternative to range RGB (have now)
5. Silk speed is not working
